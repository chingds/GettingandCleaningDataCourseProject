following website, https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip; 
and a description of how the data was collected came from the web site
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.  

One can also found it in the various files that came in the zipped data set.

In summary, the project requires one to:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
  with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Here is how it was accomplished, descriptions can also be found in the code run_analysis.R.
Merging the training and test data sets:
	The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers: subjects, each subject performed six activities (WALKING, 
  WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. The
  files downloaded includes the following:  'README.txt', 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the
  feature vector; 'features.txt': List of all features; 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name;
  'train/X_train.txt': Training set; 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels; 'test/X_test.txt': Test set; 'test/y_test.txt': Test
  labels.

Data sets were merged sequentially using rbind for each test and training set, 
followed by cbind for the activity, subject and features data.  Column names were also added accordingly:
  a. ActivityTestData from file test/Y_test.txt, combined with ActivityTrainData from file train/Y_train.txt to make ActivityData.
  b. SubjectTrainData from file train/subject_train.txt combined with SubjectTestData 
      from file test/subject_test.txt to make SubjectData; 
  c. FeaturesTestData from file test"/X_test.txt combined with FeaturesTrainData from file train/X_train.txt to make
     FeaturesData. Column names for the Features data were obtained from the file features.txt.
  d. cbind ActivityData with SubjectData to give SubActData
  e. cbind SubActData with FeaturesData to give the merged data set AllData.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  FeaturesWanted:  contains the list for measurements on the mean and standard deviation,
  subData:  the data for the subset with just the FeaturesWanted

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  activityLabels: list obtained from activity_labels.txt
		
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  From features_info.txt : 
  "The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ 
   and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
   Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency 
   of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration
   signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
   Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
  (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated 
  using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

  Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ,
  fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

  These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions."
 
 Hence, substitute column name abbreviated with the full description:
	Acc to accelerometer
	Gyro to gyroscope
	prefix 't' to time
	prefix 'f' to frequency 
	Mag to magnitude
	BodyBody to Body.
